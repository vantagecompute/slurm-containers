# Contributing to Slinky Containers

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Slinky Containers.

## Ways to contribute

1. **Report a bug, request a feature, or suggest documentation changes** Open an
   issue in this project:
   [https://github.com/SlinkyProject/containers/issues](https://github.com/SlinkyProject/containers/issues).
   For bugs, include relevant environment and version details in the issue so we
   can reproduce the problem.

1. **Propose a larger feature** Open an issue to describe the problem and
   proposed approach before investing significant implementation time, so
   maintainers can provide feedback on direction and design.

1. **Submit a fix or feature as a pull request** Follow the
   [Code contributions](#code-contributions) section below.

Issues and pull requests in this repository are handled on a **best-effort**
basis. For production support, see
[SchedMD Support](https://support.schedmd.com/).

### Signing Your Work

- We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies
  that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it
  under the same license, or a compatible license.
  - Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be
    accepted.
- To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when
  committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
