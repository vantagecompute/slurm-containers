Slinky Containers
=================

`SchedMD <https://www.schedmd.com/>`__ provides the images in the
containers repository primarily for use with
`Slinky <https://slinky.ai/>`__ - to enable the orchestration of
`Slurm <https://slurm.schedmd.com/>`__ clusters using
`Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`__. These
`OCI <https://opencontainers.org/>`__ container images track
`Slurm <https://slurm.schedmd.com/>`__ releases closely.

Image Registries
----------------

OCI artifacts are pushed to public registries:

- `GitHub <https://github.com/orgs/SlinkyProject/packages>`__

Build Slurm Images
------------------

.. code:: sh

   cd ./schedmd/slurm/
   export BAKE_IMPORTS="--file ./docker-bake.hcl --file ./$VERSION/$FLAVOR/slurm.hcl"
   docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS --print
   docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS

For example, the following will build Slurm 26.05 on Rocky Linux 9.

.. code:: sh

   cd ./schedmd/slurm/
   export BAKE_IMPORTS="--file ./docker-bake.hcl --file ./26.05/rockylinux9/slurm.hcl"
   docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS --print
   docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS

For additional instructions, see the `build guide <build.html>`__.

Build SSSD Image
----------------

.. code:: sh

   cd ./schedmd/sssd/
   export BAKE_IMPORTS="--file ./docker-bake.hcl --file ./ubuntu26.04/sssd.hcl"
   docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS --print
   docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS
