# Slinky Containers

[SchedMD] provides the images in the containers repository primarily for use
with [Slinky] - to enable the orchestration of [Slurm] clusters using
[Kubernetes]. These [OCI] container images track [Slurm] releases closely.

## Image Registries

OCI artifacts are pushed to public registries:

- [GitHub][github-registry]

## Build Slurm Images

```sh
cd ./schedmd/slurm/
export BAKE_IMPORTS="--file ./docker-bake.hcl --file ./$VERSION/$FLAVOR/slurm.hcl"
docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS --print
docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS
```

For example, the following will build Slurm 26.05 on Rocky Linux 9.

```sh
cd ./schedmd/slurm/
export BAKE_IMPORTS="--file ./docker-bake.hcl --file ./26.05/rockylinux9/slurm.hcl"
docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS --print
docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS
```

For additional instructions, see the [build guide][build-guide].

## Build SSSD Image

```sh
cd ./schedmd/sssd/
export BAKE_IMPORTS="--file ./docker-bake.hcl --file ./ubuntu26.04/sssd.hcl"
docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS --print
docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS
```
